# Vector-and-Bitmapped-images

The difference between Vector and Bitmapped images:
  Bitmapped or Raster images are used more frequently compared to Vector images. Bitmapped images are images comprised entirely off pixels collections. 
Raster file types are super well known.

  Some popular types include JPEG, GIF, TIFF, PNG, PICT. The thing is if you downloaded one of these images you've probably looked at it and scratched your head 
wondering why it looks so pixelly and gross.

Thats because compression and bitmapped images dont exactly scale. Raster images have their ups and downs but they are incredibly reliable and are used across the board for artists.


Vector images on the other hand are images based off a set of mathmatical formulas. 

What are vector graphics? Vector graphics are more formulas that define shapes colors and form. Theyuse formulas like the Bézier curve.

The Bézier curve is 


    B ( t ) = P 0 + t ( P 1 − P 0 ) = ( 1 − t ) P 0 + t P 1 ,   0 ≤ t ≤ 1 
    
Looks super complicated right?

Well it's consider t to represent a number between 0 and 1.
Then follow the inbetween of two lines and mark shortest distance between them as it as t.

Therefore the screen looking at the image can be of any size. Anything silly 
from an apple watch, dsi to a 16K resolution monitor. They are mainly used for logos or images that don't need exact colors or details. They're great at being infinitly scaleable and because they are inherently smaller because theyre code vs pixels.

When to use either kind of image is up to the dev and the their needs.
